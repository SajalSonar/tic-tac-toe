# tic-tac-toe
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using Python's Tkinter library. The game allows two players to take turns and play on a 3x3 grid. The game announces the winner once a player manages to get three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all the cells are filled and no player has won, the game declares a draw.
